Write wchar characters to an image on OpenCV 2.X using FreeType2.

You can get help [here][1].

[FreeType][2] comes with two licenses: FTL/GPLv2. I use "FreeType library" to get character information. I want to share this project on MIT license. This is my first open-source project and I really don't know well about these license. So if I make something wrong, PLEASE tell me and I'll correct it. Thank you.
